Description: The GMBA Mountain Inventory v2.0 is an inventory of 8329 mountain ranges across the world (in its standard extend), stored in a shapefile with a growing attribute table. Here, we provide a few R functions to explore the inventory and select mountain ranges based on user define criteria for subsequent analyses.
